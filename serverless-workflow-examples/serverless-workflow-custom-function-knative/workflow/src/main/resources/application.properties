# Since the Quarkus project has no java files, Quarkus 3.2.10.Final is picking the default image
# base: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-11-runtime:1.16'. Not good, since the workflows requires java 17.
# Quarkus 3.8.1 picks openjdk-17 even when no java files, so this configuration can be removed in the future.
