# Kogito with persistence powered by Infinispan

## Description

A quickstart project that processes deals for travellers. It utilizes process composition to split the work of

* submitting a deal
* reviewing a deal

At the same time shows simplified version of a approval process that waits for human actor to provide review.

This example shows

* exposing Submit Deal as public service
* each process instance is going to be evaluated and asks for review
* at any point in time service can be shutdown and when brought back it will keep the state of the instances

Note: The use of this example shows that the data sent to infinispan is saved, you can shut down the application and restart it
and as long as infinispan is running after you restart you should still see the data

It utilizes Infinispan server as the backend store.

### Submit a deal

To make use of this application it is as simple as putting a sending request to `http://localhost:8080/deals`  with following content 

```
{
"name" : "my fancy deal",
"traveller" : { 
  "firstName" : "John", 
  "lastName" : "Doe", 
  "email" : "jon.doe@example.com", 
  "nationality" : "American",
  "address" : { 
  	"street" : "main street", 
  	"city" : "Boston", 
  	"zipCode" : "10005", 
  	"country" : "US" }
  }
}

```

Complete curl command can be found below:

```
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -H 'Accept:application/json' -d '{"name" : "my fancy deal", "traveller" : { "firstName" : "John", "lastName" : "Doe", "email" : "jon.doe@example.com", "nationality" : "American","address" : { "street" : "main street", "city" : "Boston", "zipCode" : "10005", "country" : "US" }}}' http://localhost:8080/deals
```

this will then trigger the review user task that you can work.

### Get review task for given deal

First you can display all active reviews of deals

```
curl -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -H 'Accept:application/json' http://localhost:8080/dealreviews/{uuid}/tasks?user=john
```

where uuid is the id of the deal review you want to work with.

Next you can get the details assigned to review user task by

```
curl -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -H 'Accept:application/json' http://localhost:8080/dealreviews/{uuid}/review/{tuuid}?user=john
```

where uuid is the id of the deal review and tuuid is the id of the user task you want to get
