# Kogito Examples

This module contains a number of examples that you can take a look at and try out yourself.  Please take a look at the readme of each individual example for more details on how the example works and how to run it yourself (either locally or on Kubernetes).

Since Kogito aims at supporting both Quarkus and Spring Boot each example usually provides both type of projects.

- Default branch is `stable`, pointing to the latest released version.
- **[You can also check all versions by looking at releases.](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/releases/latest)**

## Use alternative Quarkus platforms

The Quarkus quickstarts by default currently use the Quarkus core BOM.

If you want to use an alternative BOM when building the Quarkus quickstarts you can override the `quarkus.platform.*` properties. The following example shows how to set `quarkus.platform.artifact-id` to use the quarkus-universe-bom.

```
mvn -Dquarkus.platform.artifact-id=quarkus-universe-bom clean install
```

Because the Kogito project is part of the Quarkus Platform, the same applies also to Kogito BOM being used.

By default `org.kie.kogito:kogito-bom` is used, but, when needed, this can be overridden using Maven properties:
* `kogito.bom.*` for Kogito BOM overrides

The properties defined in each of the modules and can be overridden as follows:
* Kogito BOM
  ```
  mvn -Dkogito.bom.group-id=io.quarkus.platform -Dkogito.bom.artifact-id=quarkus-kogito-bom -Dkogito.bom.version=2.2.3.Final
  ```
> Note: It's important to keep BOM versions aligned when overriding. In case of Quarkus Platform this means using a single
> version value for all two (`quarkus.platform.version`, `kogito.bom.version`) properties.

## Trying the examples with the Kogito Operator

Most examples have a directory named `operator` including the YAML files to deploy it using the Kogito Operator in an OpenShift cluster.
Please refer to the [Kogito Documentation](https://docs.jboss.org/kogito/release/latest/html_single/#chap_kogito-deploying-on-openshift)
of how to install the operator to your environment in order to try it there.
