# jBPM + OptaPlanner + SpringBoot example

## Description

A simple process service for an airline scheduling flights and optimizing seat
assignments using OptaPlanner.

It uses an event-based subprocess to simulate
passengers buying tickets, who the airline security officer must approve via
a user task before the passenger is allowed to get a ticket.

The main process waits for a user task to be completed to finalize the passenger list.
It then invokes a custom Java service `FlightSeatingSolveService.assignSeats`
to optimize the flight's seats following the rules in `FlightSeatingConstraintProvider`
using OptaPlanner's, followed by a user task to finalize seat assignments.

Based on these two processes (defined using BPMN 2.0 format), the custom data object
and custom Java service, a new service is generated that exposes REST operations to
create new flights (following the steps as defined in the main and sub-process)
and add passengers to flights.

A UI is included in this example, which can be accessed on `localhost:8080`
when the application is running.

## Installing and Running

### Prerequisites

You will need:
  - Java 11+ installed
  - Environment variable JAVA_HOME set accordingly
  - Maven 3.6.2+ installed

## Installing and Running

```
mvn clean package spring-boot:run    
```

## OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation
[Specification at swagger.io](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/)

You can take a look at the [OpenAPI definition](http://localhost:8080/swagger.json) - automatically generated and included in this service - to determine all available operations exposed by this service. For easy readability you can visualize the OpenAPI definition file using a UI tool like for example available [Swagger UI](https://editor.swagger.io).

In addition, various clients to interact with this service can be easily generated using this OpenAPI definition.

## Example Usage

Once the service is up and running, you can access the UI at `localhost:8080` or use
the following examples to interact with the service.

### POST  /rest/flights

Allows to create a new flight with the given data:

```sh
curl -d '{ "params": { "origin" : "JFK", "destination": "SFO", "departureDateTime": "2020-01-01T12:00", "seatRowSize": 8, "seatColumnSize": 6 } }' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8080/rest/flights
```
or on windows

```sh
curl -d "{\"params\": { \"origin\" : \"JFK\", \"destination\": \"SFO\", \"departureDateTime\": \"2020-01-01T12:00\", \"seatRowSize\": 8, \"seatColumnSize\": 6 }}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8080/rest/flights
```

As response the created flight is returned (in field "flight").
Example response:

```json
