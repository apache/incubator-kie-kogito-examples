# Kogito with persistence and transaction powered by MongoDB and SpringBoot

## Description

This example shows how to enable storing Kogito process data and publishing Kogito events of the same unit of work within one MongoDB transaction.

With the approach, the Kogito event consistency issue can be solved by implementing the outbox pattern with Debezium.

For the complete example of the outbox pattern, please refer to the [process-outbox-mongodb-debezium](../process-outbox-mongodb-debezium) example.
