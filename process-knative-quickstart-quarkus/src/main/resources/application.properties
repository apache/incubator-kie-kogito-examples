# avoid Smallrye CloudEvent Serializers to be initialized on build time. It will try to initialize CloudEvents Serializer that's not been used.
# We use CloudEvents SDK directly instead. By turning `--allow-incomplete-classpath` option, the native image will be built successfully and since
# this branch will never be called in runtime, no errors would be thrown.
# See: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-3623
