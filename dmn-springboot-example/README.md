# DMN + Spring Boot example

## Description

A simple DMN service to evaluate a traffic violation.

## Installing and Running

### Prerequisites

You will need:
  - Java 11+ installed
  - Environment variable JAVA_HOME set accordingly
  - Maven 3.6.2+ installed

### Compile and Run

```sh
mvn clean compile spring-boot:run
```

### Package and Run

```sh
mvn clean package
java -jar ./target/dmn-springboot-example.jar
```

## Test DMN Model using Maven

Validate the functionality of DMN models before deploying them into a production environment by defining test scenarios in Test Scenario Editor. 

To define test scenarios you need to create a .scesim file inside your project and link it to the DMN model you want to be tested. Run all Test Scenarios, executing:

```sh
mvn clean test
```
See results in surefire test report `target/surefire-reports` 

## Example Usage

Once the service is up and running, you can use the following example to interact with the service.

### POST /Traffic Violation

Returns penalty information from the given inputs -- driver and violation:
Given inputs:

```json
{
    "Driver":{ "Points":2 },
    "Violation":{
        "Type":"speed",
        "Actual Speed":120,
        "Speed Limit":100
    }
}
```

Curl command (using the JSON object above):

```sh
curl -X POST -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"Driver":{"Points":2},"Violation":{"Type":"speed","Actual Speed":120,"Speed Limit":100}}' http://localhost:8080/Traffic%20Violation
```

As response, penalty information is returned.

Example response:
```json
{
  "Violation":{
    "Type":"speed",
    "Speed Limit":100,
    "Actual Speed":120
  },
  "Driver":{
    "Points":2
  },
  "Fine":{
    "Points":3,
    "Amount":500
  },
  "Should the driver be suspended?":"No"
}
```


## Deploying with Kogito Operator

In the [`operator`](operator) directory you'll find the custom resources needed to deploy this example on OpenShift with the [Kogito Operator](https://docs.jboss.org/kogito/release/latest/html_single/#chap_kogito-deploying-on-openshift).

## Developer notes

In order to have the DMN generated resources properly scanned by Spring Boot, please ensure the DMN model namespaces is included in the resource scanning configuration files. For example, in `application.properties` file:

```
resteasy.jaxrs.scan-packages=org.kie.kogito.**,http*
```

The generated classes must be included in the annotation definitions of the main `Application` class:

```
@SpringBootApplication(scanBasePackages={"org.kie.dmn.kogito.**", "org.kie.kogito.app.**"})
public class KogitoSpringbootApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(KogitoSpringbootApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```
