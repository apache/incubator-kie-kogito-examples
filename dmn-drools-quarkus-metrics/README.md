# Drools + Quarkus + Runtime metrics

## Description

This example demonstrates how to enable and consume the runtime metrics monitoring feature in Kogito. 

### Prerequisites
 
You will need:
  - Java 11+ installed 
  - Environment variable JAVA_HOME set accordingly
  - Maven 3.6.2+ installed
  
### How to enable the feature

Import the following dependency in your `pom.xml` if you are using quarkus:

```XML
<dependency>
 <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
 <artifactId>monitoring-prometheus-quarkus-addon</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Otherwise, if you are using springboot import
```XML
<dependency>
 <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
 <artifactId>monitoring-prometheus-springboot-addon</artifactId></dependency>
```

### Architecture

Once you compile your Quarkus project, a dashboard for each available endpoint will be generated under the path `target/resources/dashboards/`. You can then inject those grafana dashboards during the deployment of the grafana instance.

The use case is summarized in the following schema:

To summarize, the kogito app will expose by default an endpoint `/metrics` with the prometheus variables, and a prometheus instance will simply fetch the data from there.

### Dashboards

Kogito currently exports two types of dashboards depending on the model used on the endpoint:
1. Operational dashboard: this dashboard is generated for DMN and DRL endpoints and it contains
    * Total number of requests on the endpoint.
    * Average per minute of the number of requests on the endpoint.
    * Quantiles on the elapsed time to evaluate the requests.
    * Exception details.

2. Domain specific dashboard: currently this dashboard is exported only for DMN endpoints. In particular, the domain specific dashboard contains a graph for each type of decision in the DMN model. At the moment, only the built-in types `number`, `string` and `boolean` are supported:
   * if the output of the decision is a number, the graph contains the quantiles for that metric (on a sliding window of 3 minutes).
   * If the output is a boolean or a string, the graph contains the number of occurrences for each output (10 minutes average).

You can use these default dashboards, or you can personalize them and use your custom dashboards.

### Compile and Run in Local Dev Mode

It is possible to use `docker-compose` to demonstrate how to inject the generated dashboards in the volume of the grafana container:
1. Run `mvn clean package` to build the project and generate dashboards. 
2. Run `docker-compose build` to build the docker images.
2. Run `docker-compose up` to start the applications. 

The volumes of the grafana container are properly set in the `docker-compose.yml` file, so that the dashboards are properly loaded at startup.

## Example Usage

Once the service is up and running, you can use the following example to interact with the service.

### POST /hello

Post "hello":

```sh
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"strings":["world"]}' http://localhost:8080/hello
```

the service will return `["hello", "world"]`

### POST /LoanEligibility

Post:

```sh
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/LoanEligibility' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "Client": {"age": 43,"salary": 1950, "existing payments": 100},
        "Loan": {"duration": 15,"installment": 180}, 
        "SupremeDirector" : "Yes", 
        "Bribe": 1000
    }'
```

the service will return the decision results.  

If you are using the `docker-compose` script we provided, go to `localhost:3000` and have a look at your dashboards.
