# jBPM + SpringBoot example

## Description

A simple process service for ordering items, as a sequence of a script task (writing out some debug info) and a call activity invoking a sub-process, using a custom `Order` data element.

The sub-process invokes a custom Java service `CalculationService.calculateTotal`, followed by a user task to verify the order.

Based on these two processes (defined using BPMN 2.0 format), the custom data object and custom Java service, a new service is generated that exposes REST operations to create new orders (following the steps as defined in the main and sub-process), or to list and delete active orders.

## Installing and Running

### Prerequisites
 
You will need:
  - Java 11+ installed 
  - Environment variable JAVA_HOME set accordingly
  - Maven 3.6.2+ installed

## Installing and Running

```
mvn clean package spring-boot:run    
```

### Running with persistence enabled

Kogito supports runtime persistence that is backed by Inifinispan. So to be able to enable this you need to have 
Infinispan server installed and available over the network. By default it expects it to be at (it can be configured via application.properties file located in src/main/resources)

```
localhost:11222
```

You can install Infinispan server by downloading it from [Infinispan website](https://infinispan.org/download/), you should use version 10.0.x.  To enable our simplified demo setup, go to /server/conf/infinispan.xml and remove the security domain from the endpoints definition:

```
<endpoints socket-binding="default">
```

Once Infinispan is up and running you can build this project with `-Ppersistence` to enable additional processing during the build. Next you start it in exact same way as without persistence.

This extra profile in maven configuration adds additional dependencies needed to work with Infinispan as persistent store.

## Example Usage

Once the service is up and running, you can use the following examples to interact with the service.

### POST /orders

Allows to create a new order with the given data:

```sh
curl -d '{"approver" : "john", "order" : {"orderNumber" : "12345", "shipped" : false}}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8080/orders
```
or on windows

```sh
curl -d "{\"approver\" : \"john\", \"order\" : {\"orderNumber\" : \"12345\", \"shipped\" : false}}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8080/orders

  "name":"Verify order"
}
```

### POST /orderItems/{id}/Verify_order/{tid}

Complete user task

```sh
curl -d '{}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8080/orderItems/66c11e3e-c211-4cee-9a07-848b5e861bc5/Verify_order/62f1c985-d31c-4ead-9906-2fe8d05937f0
