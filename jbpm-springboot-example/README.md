# jBPM + SpringBoot example

## Description

A simple process service for ordering items, as a sequence of a script task (writing out some debug info) and a call activity invoking a sub-process, using a custom `Order` data element.

The sub-process invokes a custom Java service `CalculationService.calculateTotal`, followed by a user task to verify the order.

Based on these two processes (defined using BPMN 2.0 format), the custom data object and custom Java service, a new service is generated that exposes REST operations to create new orders (following the steps as defined in the main and sub-process), or to list and delete active orders.

## Installing and Running

### Prerequisites
 
You will need:
  - Java 1.8.0+ installed 
  - Environment variable JAVA_HOME set accordingly
  - Maven 3.5.4+ installed

## Installing and Running

```
mvn clean package spring-boot:run    
```

## Swagger documentation

You can take a look at the [swagger definition](http://localhost:8080/docs/swagger.json) - automatically generated and included in this service - to determine all available operations exposed by this service.  For easy readability you can visualize the swagger definition file using a swagger UI like for example available [here](https://editor.swagger.io). In addition, various clients to interact with this service can be easily generated using this swagger definition.

## Example Usage

Once the service is up and running, you can use the following examples to interact with the service.

### POST /orders

Allows to create a new order with the given data:

```sh
curl -d '{"approver" : "john", "order" : {"orderNumber" : "12345", "shipped" : false}}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X POST http://localhost:8080/orders
```

As response the updated order is returned.

### GET /orders

Returns list of orders currently active:

```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/orders
```

As response an array of orders is returned.

### GET /orders/{id}

Returns order with given id (if active):

```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/orders/1
```

As response a single order is returned if found, otherwise no content (204) is returned.

### DELETE /orders/{id}

Cancels order with given id

```sh
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/orders/1
```
