# Process user tasks with timer: Hiring

## Description

This Quickstart showcases a basic implementation of the **Hiring** process. 

This quickstart project shows very typical user task orchestration with a timer that avoids to execute the HR Interview task 
after some reasonable time.(configured for test purposes to 40 seconds)

> **_NOTE:_** This example uses keycloak authentication to enable security only in the consoles and not in runtime.

The required *Kogito and Infrastructure Services* for this example are:

- Infinispan
- Kafka
- Kogito Data Index
- Kogito Jobs Service 
- Kogito Management Console
- Kogito Task Console
- Keycloak

## Running the Quickstart

### Prerequisites

* Java 11+ installed
* Environment variable JAVA_HOME set accordingly
* Maven 3.6.2+ installed
* Docker and Docker Compose to run the required example infrastructure.

And when using native image compilation, you will also need: 
  - GraalVM 20.3+ installed
  - Environment variable GRAALVM_HOME set accordingly
  - GraalVM native image needs as well native-image extension: https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/
  - Note that GraalVM native image compilation typically requires other packages (glibc-devel, zlib-devel and gcc) to be installed too, please refer to GraalVM installation documentation for more details.

### Starting the Kogito and Infrastructure Services

This quickstart provides a docker compose template that starts all the required services. This setup ensures that all services are connected with a default configuration.

<p align="center"><img width=75% height=50% src="docs/images/services.png"></p>

You should start all the services before you execute any of the **Hiring** example, to do that please execute:

For Linux and MacOS:

1. Open a Terminal
2. Go to the process-usertasks-timer-quarkus-with-console folder at kogito-examples
3. Run the ```startServices.sh``` script

```bash
sh ./startServices.sh
```

Once all services bootstrap, the following ports will be assigned on your local machine:

- Infinispan: 11222
- Kafka: 9092
- Data Index: 8180
- Jobs Service: 8580
- Management Console: 8280
- Task Console: 8380
- Keycloak: 8480

> **_NOTE:_**  This step requires the project to be compiled, please consider running a ```mvn clean install``` command on the project root before running the ```startServices.sh``` script for the first time or any time you modify the project.

Once started you can simply stop all services by executing the ```docker-compose stop```.

All created containers can be removed by executing the ```docker-compose rm```.

### Using Keycloak as Authentication Server

In this Quickstart we'll be using [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) as *Authentication Server*. It will be started as a part of the project *Infrastructure Services*, you can check the configuration on the project [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose/docker-compose.yml) in [docker-compose](docker-compose) folder.

It will install the *Kogito Realm* that comes with a predefined set of users:
| Login         | Password   | Roles               |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
|    admin      |   admin    | *admin*, *managers* |
|    alice      |   alice    | *user*              |
|    jdoe       |   jdoe     | *managers*          |

Once Keycloak is started, you should be able to access your *Keycloak Server* at [localhost:8480/auth](http://localhost:8480/auth) with *admin* user.

### Compile and Run Hiring example process in Local Dev Mode

Once all the infrastructure services are ready, you can start the Hiring example by doing:

1. Open a Terminal
2. Go to the process-usertasks-timer-quarkus-with-console folder at kogito-examples
3.- Start the example with the command
```bash
mvn clean package quarkus:dev
```

NOTE: With dev mode of Quarkus you can take advantage of hot reload for business assets like processes, rules, decision tables and java code. No need to redeploy or restart your running application.


### Package and Run in JVM mode

```sh
mvn clean package
java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
```

or on windows

```sh
mvn clean package
java -jar target\quarkus-app\quarkus-run.jar
```

### Package and Run using Local Native Image
Note that this requires GRAALVM_HOME to point to a valid GraalVM installation

```sh
mvn clean package -Pnative
```

To run the generated native executable, generated in `target/`, execute

```sh
./target/process-usertasks-timer-quarkus-with-console-runner
```

### Submit a request to start new hiring

Once the service is up and running you can make use of the **Hiring** application by a sending request to `http://localhost:8080/hiring`  with following content:
```json
{   
    "candidate": {
        "name": "Harry Potter",
        "email": "harrypotter@example.com",
        "salary": 30000,
        "skills": "Java, Kogito"
    }
}
```
In a Terminal, you can execute the following command to start a **Hiring** process for the "Harry Potter" candidate:
```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8080/hiring -d @- << EOF
{   
    "candidate": {
        "name": "Harry Potter",
        "email": "harrypotter@example.com",
        "salary": 30000,
        "skills": "Java, Kogito"
    }
}
EOF
```

### Show active Hiring process instance at Kogito Management Console

To access the Kogito Management Console just open your browser and navigate to ``http://localhost:8280``. You'll be redirected to the *Keycloak* log in page.

<p align="center">
    <img width=75%  src="docs/images/keycloak-login.png">
