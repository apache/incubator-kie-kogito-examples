# Kogito Serverless Workflow - gRPC example

The goal of this example is to implement a simple gRPC example for serverless workflow

You first need to run the gRPC server, check /serverless-workflow-greeting-server-rpc-quarkus readme in order to do that. 
Once the gRPC server is running, you can run the quarkus application following serverless-workflow-greeting-client-rpc-quarkus readme.
