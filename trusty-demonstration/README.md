# Trusty demonstation

This is a demonstration of the trusty AI tracing capabilities. 

NOTE: In order to play with the demo, ensure that you are on the stable branch or on the branch of a specific release (for example the branch for the release `0.17` is `0.17.x`).
The `master` branch is aligned to the latest changes in all the repositories. This means that `master` might be using some new operator features not included in the release that we use in this demo: don't use it!

In the two subfolders [kubernetes](/kubernetes) and [docker-compose](/docker-compose) you can find all the instructions to run the demo on `kubernetes` and `docker-compose`.
