## Deployment to OpenShift

NOTE: Make sure that submarine S2I image builders are available to your OpenShift environment

### Build from local workspace

* Go to payroll project root directory
* Create new binary build and start it by uploading content of the current directory

```sh
oc new-build myproject/kaas-quarkus-centos-s2i --binary=true --name=payroll-service-builder
oc start-build payroll-service-builder --from-dir . --incremental=true
```

Once the build is completed create new build for runtime image

```sh
oc new-build --name payroll-service --source-image=payroll-service-builder --source-image-path=/home/submarine/bin:. --image-stream=kaas-quarkus-centos
```

Next create application for the runtime image

```sh
oc new-app payroll-service:latest -l taxRate=process,vacationDays=process,paymentDate=process
```

and lastly create the route for it

```sh
oc expose svc/payroll-service
```

You can inspect [swagger docs](http://localhost:8082/docs/swagger.json) to learn more about the service.

## Knative
