# Sample OnboardingService

## Description

This example illustrates how you can build a complete onboarding solution by combining multiple services (based on business processes and decisions).

It consists of three independent services:

* onboarding - main service where you can start onboarding new employees (defined as a set of 3 business processes)
* hr - a decision service responsible for HR-related activities (using DRL rules)
* payroll - a decision service responsible for payroll-related activities (using DMN)

Users will typically only interact with the main onboarding service, but this one relies on the other two to manage some of the work.

You can run the example in any of the following configurations:
* As local services using quarkus dev mode
* As local services using native images
* Running on top of Kubernetes
* Running on top of knative

## Installing and Running

### Prerequisites
 
You will need:
  - Java 11+ installed 
  - Environment variable JAVA_HOME set accordingly
  - Maven 3.6.2+ installed

When using native image compilation, you will also need: 
  - [GraalVM 19.1.1](https://github.com/oracle/graal/releases/tag/vm-19.1.1) installed 
  - Environment variable GRAALVM_HOME set accordingly
  - Note that GraalVM native image compilation typically requires other packages (glibc-devel, zlib-devel and gcc) to be installed too.  You also need 'native-image' installed in GraalVM (using 'gu install native-image'). Please refer to [GraalVM installation documentation](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/aot-compilation/#prerequisites) for more details.

### Installation

Please follow the instruction for each of the individual services

* [hr](hr/README.md)
* [payroll](payroll/README.md)
* [onboarding](onboarding/README.md)

## Example Usage

Once the services are up and running, please use the sample request as described in the onboarding service readme to start a new onboarding.
